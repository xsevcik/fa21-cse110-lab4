1. Line 12 will print the value of `i` which in this case is 3.
2. Line 13 will print the last calculated value of `dicountedPrice`, which in this case is 150.
3. Line 14 will print the last calculated value of `finalPrice`, which in this case is 150 again.
4. This code will take a set of prices, apply a given discount to each, then return the total price of the discounted goods. In this case, it will return 300.
5. Line 12 will cause an error because `i` is no longer in scope due to it being declared with the `let` keyword.
6. Line 13 will cause an error because `discountedPrice` is no longer in scope due to it being declared within the loop with the `let` keyword.
7. Line 14 will print the last calculated value of `finalPrice`, which in this case is 150.
8. This function works much the same as before, and will take a list of values, apply a given discount to each, then return the sum of the discounted prices. In this case, it will return 300.
9. Line 11 will cause an error because `i` is out of scope after the `for` loop.
10. Line 12 will return the length of the input array, in this case 3.
11. The code will cause errors because there will be multiple redefinitions of constants. It will return an empty array no matter the input.
